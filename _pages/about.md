Welcome to my academic website. I am an Economics Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/class/economics/). I'm originally from [Owensboro, Kentucky, US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owensboro%2C_Kentucky), and recieved a B.S. in Mathematical Economics and a M.A. in Applied Economics from [Western Kentucky University](https://www.wku.edu/economics/). My academic interests include time-series econometrics, business cycles, fiscal/monetary policy, income/wealth inequality, behavioral macroeconomics, and expectation formation. If you want to contact me, you can email me at wrbennett@uh.edu.
