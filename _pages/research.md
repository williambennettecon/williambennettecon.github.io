Predicting forecaster inattention
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 90%;">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Economic forecasters have been documented as deviating from having both full information and rational expectations. The sticky information model attempts to explain economic forecasters deviating from having both full information and rational expectations by assuming information rigidity: each period a fraction $\lambda$ of forecasters do not get their information sets updated. To explain the data, empirical findings use calibration or follow Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) and estimate $\lambda$ using aggregated regressions. This leads to large estimates, with up to 50% of forecasters not receiving information each quarter. Adapting Andrade and Bihan (2013) and Giacomini et al. (2020), I employ a different estimation strategy using data from the US survey of professional forecasters and provide evidence that $\lambda$ is 10 times smaller. My results imply that some other, stronger source of information rigidity must be present, and thus a model accounting for information rigidity should not use sticky information as its only mechanism. I also document novel state-dependence and show how individual and group forecast errors affect the likelihood of forecasts being sticky, with the effects being heterogeneous and nonlinear across forecast horizons.</em>

Optimal income tax progressivity over the business cycle
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; text-align: justify;  font-size: 90%;">
<strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>I study optimal progressive income taxation in an incomplete-markets model with aggregate state-dependent skewed idiosyncratic income risk and a two-state regime switching process for aggregate productivity. A Ramsey planner is constrained to two log-linear tax and transfer functions, one for each aggregate state, to allow state-dependent progressivity. I take recent computational techniques used for aggregate MIT shocks and adapt them to work for regime switching processes. I find that the negative skewness of income risk during recessions leads to higher optimal progressivity than the less-skewed risk in expansions. I also find that the welfare difference from optimal policy between an income process that incorporates skewness and a misspecified process that does not can be upward of 30%.</em>
