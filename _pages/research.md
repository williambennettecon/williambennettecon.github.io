Predicting forecaster inattention
<p style="margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px; text-align: justify;">
<small><em>Economic forecasters have been documented as deviating from having both full information and rational expectations. The sticky information model attempts to explain economic forecasters deviating from having both full information and rational expectations by assuming information rigidity: each period a fraction $\lambda$ of forecasters do not get their information sets updated. To explain the data, empirical findings use calibration or follow Coibion and Gorodnichenko (2015) and estimate $\lambda$ using aggregated regressions. This leads to large estimates, with up to 50% of forecasters not receiving information each quarter. Adapting Andrade and Bihan (2013) and Giacomini et al. (2020), I employ a different estimation strategy using data from the US survey of professional forecasters and provide evidence that $\lambda$ is 10 times smaller. My results imply that some other, stronger source of information rigidity must be present, and thus a model accounting for information rigidity should not use sticky information as its only mechanism. I also document novel state-dependence and show how individual and group forecast errors affect the likelihood of forecasts being sticky, with the effects being heterogeneous and nonlinear across forecast horizons.</em>
